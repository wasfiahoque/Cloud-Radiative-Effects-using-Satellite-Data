We use data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments aboard both the Aqua and Terra satellites, specifically the Energy Balancedand Filled (EBAF) Level 3b Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) product. The EBAF dataset provides 1° ×1° global monthly mean LW and SW radiative fluxes under clear-sky and all-sky conditions. Thec lear-sky TOA (SW and LW) fluxes provide radiative fluxes under clear sky conditions  while all-sky TOA (SW and LW) provide the radiative fluxes under both cloudy and clear skies.
CERES Top-of-Atmosphere radiative flux data were obtained from NASA Langley Research Center. The data can be downloaded from the CERES data portal: https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/


We also use data from CloudSat’s Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) contained within the 2B- GEOPROF product to analyze the vertical structure of clouds during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons in South Asia. CloudSat granules were downloaded from the CloudSat Data Processing Center (DPC) website:
